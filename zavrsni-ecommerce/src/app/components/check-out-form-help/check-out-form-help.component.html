<h2>This is a tutorial on how to fill in the checkout form</h2>

<p>First you have to enter your legal first and last name, and your email address. After entering your personal
    information, you have to enter a shipping and billing address. If your shipping and billing address are the same
    you can use the "copyShippingAddressToBillingAddress" button in order to copy shipping address to billing address.
    If your shipping and billing address are not the same, enter each one individually.

    At the end of the checkout form, you will be shown expected expenses such as VAT, and shipping costs.
    VAT is calculated at 25% of the total value of all the items purchased, and shipping at 0.4% the total original value.
